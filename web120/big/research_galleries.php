        <p>How to render images on websites is always a thorny issue. There are countless options for different methods for displaying images, especially when you have a large number of them. The most common solution is a gallery of some sort. They are easiest to set up with some combination of CSS and JavaScript. Depending on the context in which the images need to be displayed, they can be configured in different ways. It can be something as simple as the ability to bring up a full-page view of a single image, or something as complex as a gallery with searchable tags, which users can add their own images to.</p>

        <p>These image galleries are available usually for no cost, and only require a small credit to be added to the bottom of any page they are placed on. Making use of a premade image gallery web application is a tremendous saver of time and money for any business. There&rsquo;s no need to reinvent the wheel, unless you have extremely particular needs. There are even some that offer custom-ordered themes, such as Sequence.js, if you have a particularly strict style guide for your site.</p>

        <p>If you wish to keep your content accessible to as wide an audience as possible, then you can also use older, less dynamic HTML options. For example, the site Wikipedia has a custom page for every image with abundant information, and in lieu of a gallery it simply brings the user to that when an image is clicked. It is a little less dynamic, but it allows you to have more direct control over the user&rsquo;s experience and be sure that nothing will break in the process.</p>
