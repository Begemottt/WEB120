                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>My name is Robin VanGilder. I am a student in the web design program at Seattle Central College. On this site, you will find many examples of the work I 
                    have done for this class, WEB120: Web Authoring II. I enjoy designing websites, especially making little visual flourishes with Illustrator and Photoshop.</p>
                <p>I am a life-long West Seattleite. I also run a blog where I am writing about every chapter of Moby-Dick; or, the Whale. In my free time, I enjoy playing video
                    games, reading, and drinking beer and tea.</p>
